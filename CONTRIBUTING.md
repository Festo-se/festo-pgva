## Restrictions on Generative AI Usage

Due to the increasing amount of automated, LLM-derived traffic, and due to the fact we are a small team, we must place the following restrictions on the usage of generative AI output:

1. Pull requests, issue creation, and comments on the repository shall not be generated using an LLM or generative AI. Such content presents a substantial impediment to content-ful and meaningful collaboration with our users. 

2. It is incumbent upon any contributing developer to understand **ALL** changes they contribute, whether it be to documentation, tests, or the codebase itself, whether or not they are generatively derived from an LLM or other source. Any contributing developer shall take great care when using generative tools to aid in their contributions and verify that they understand what they are contributing. 


We reserve the right to summarily decline any pull request and close any issue that does not meet these requirements. Repeat offenders will be warned and then banned from discussions and contributions.
